## Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have the following installed:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42) (the graphics library used)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarTou76/cub3D
   cd cub3D
   ```

2. Compile the cub3D project:

   ```bash
   make bonus
   ```

## Running the Game

To run the game with bonus features, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ./cub3D_bonus maps/bonus/42.cub
   ```

You can select any map located in the maps directory by replacing maps/bonus/42.cub with the path to your desired map file. Additionally, you have the option to create your own map, where you can use your own textures and choose the colors for the ceiling and the floor.


## Features

- 3D rendering using raycasting techniques.
- Support for multiple map formats.
- Ability to create and load custom maps.
- Bonus features including enhanced graphics and gameplay mechanics.

## Usage

Once the game is running, you can navigate the 3D environment using the following controls:

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **Arrow Keys**: Look around
- **F**: Shoot with the pistol
- **M**: Open the map
- **ESC**: Exit the game
